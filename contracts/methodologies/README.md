On-chain carbon offset methodologies

## Getting Started

These contracts allow you to implement carbon offset methodologies as smart contracts. Methodologies are currently limited to 32 variables for each contract. The variables are 64-bit signed fixed point numbers.

The interfaces are designed to work mostly with numbers, but flags and other metadata can be appended to the end. The specific methodology implementation should have the variable and bit structure in the doc string.
